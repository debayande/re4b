# Code patterns

All the code in this document has been generated using GCC 4.8.5-4ubuntu8 on
Pop!\_OS 18.04. Flags that were switched on are:

* `-fno-stack-protector`
* `-g`
* `-m32|64`
* `-masm=intel`
* `-mtune=generic`
* `-O3` (on optimised builds)
* `-S`

## Empty functions

```
    void f()
    {
        return;
    }
```

```
    ; gcc 4.8.5 (gcc 4.8.5-4ubuntu8) x86, -O3

    f:
        rep ret
```

* The instruction, `ret` returns execution to the caller.
* Two uses of empty functions are to implement debugging and feature locking for shareware.

## On returning values

```
    int f()
    {
        return 1337;
    }
```

```
    ; gcc 4.8.5 (gcc 4.8.5-4ubuntu8) x86, -O3

    f:
        movl  $1337, %eax   ; places 1337 into eax
        ret                 ; returns execution to the caller, who, by
                            ; convention, reads the return value from eax
```

* In practice, functions which merely return `0` or `1` are very frequent.

## Hello, world!

```
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main()
    {
        printf("Hello, world!");
        return 0;
    }
```

```
.LC0:
	.string	"Hello, world!"
main:
	push	ebp
	mov	ebp, esp
	and	esp, -16
	sub	esp, 16
	mov	DWORD PTR [esp], OFFSET FLAT:.LC0
	call	puts
	mov	eax, 0
	leave
	ret
```

```
.LC0:
	.string	"Hello, world!"
main:
	push	rbp
	mov	rbp, rsp
	mov	edi, OFFSET FLAT:.LC0
	call	puts
	mov	eax, 0
	pop	rbp
	ret
```

* In order to use the stack less often (in other words, in order to have to 
access external caches or memory less often), a popular pattern is to pass part 
of a function's set of arguments using registers and the rest using the stack. 
In \*BSD, Linux and macOS, the first 6 arguments to a function are passed in 
using the `rdi`, `rsi`, `rdx`, `rcx`, `r8` and `r9` registers. The rest are 
passed in using the stack.
